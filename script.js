// H/A #7

// 1) In the center of the page there is a button that says Click me! When you hover over it with a 50% probability, it disappears and appears in a random place. When clicked, it does the same with 100% probability.

// 2) The page consists of two halves: a stopwatch and a timer. The functionality is appropriate, you can receive data for the timer simply by text input, or you can use buttons like “+1m.”. Accurate down to seconds.
